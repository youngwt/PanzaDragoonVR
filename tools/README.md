## Build toolchain for Quest 3

`setup-toolchain.sh` installs everything needed to build a Godot C# app for the Quest 3. It is safe to run again: parts already installed are skipped and nothing is downloaded.

```sh
tools/setup-toolchain.sh           # install whatever is missing
tools/setup-toolchain.sh --check   # print the versions found; exits non-zero if a part is missing
```

It needs `bash`, `curl`, `unzip`, `tar`, `jq`, `awk`, `find`, `sha256sum` and `sha512sum`, all of which SteamOS and the VS Code Flatpak sandbox already have.

### Licence acceptance

**Running `setup-toolchain.sh` accepts the Android SDK licence terms on your behalf.** It answers "yes" to every licence `sdkmanager --licenses` offers. Read them at <https://developer.android.com/studio/terms> before running it if you have not agreed to them.

### What is installed, and where

Everything goes under `~/.local/opt`; set the `TOOLCHAIN_ROOT` environment variable before running the script or sourcing `tools/toolchain-env.sh` to use another folder (the default is `~/.local/opt`). Nothing is installed system-wide, nothing is added to your shell profile, and nothing lands in this repository.

| Part | Folder in `~/.local/opt` | Size | Source | Verified against |
|------|--------------------------|------|--------|------------------|
| Godot 4.7.2-stable, .NET build, with export templates | `godot-4.7.2-stable-mono` | 2.1 GB | Godot's GitHub release | the release's `SHA512-SUMS.txt` |
| .NET 9 SDK | `dotnet-9` | 580 MB | Microsoft's `dotnet-install.sh`, channel 9.0 | no published checksum for the install script |
| Temurin JDK 17 | `jdk-17` | 320 MB | Adoptium API, latest 17 | the SHA-256 the API gives |
| Android SDK: command-line tools, `platform-tools` (`adb`), `build-tools;36.1.0`, `platforms;android-36` | `android-sdk` | 490 MB | Google | the SHA-256 on developer.android.com for the command-line tools; `sdkmanager` checks the packages it fetches |

About 3.5 GB in all. Setup also needs roughly 3 GB of temporary space in `~/.local/opt/.toolchain-setup-tmp`, which it removes when it finishes or fails.

Ghidra and its JDK 21 in `~/.local/opt` are not touched.

Godot runs in self-contained mode (an empty `._sc_` file beside the binary), so its editor settings and export templates live in `godot-4.7.2-stable-mono/editor_data` and are the same whether Godot is started from the VS Code sandbox or from the host. It does not use any settings in `~/.config/godot` or `~/.local/share/godot`.

Two tools keep small caches outside `~/.local/opt` when they run: `sdkmanager` and `adb` use `~/.android`, and `dotnet` uses `~/.dotnet` and `~/.nuget`.

### Using it

Source the environment file to get the paths. It only sets variables, so it works before setup has run too.

```sh
. tools/toolchain-env.sh
"$GODOT" --headless --version    # 4.7.2.stable.mono...
dotnet --version
java -version
adb version
```

It sets `GODOT`, `GODOT_DIR`, `GODOT_EXPORT_TEMPLATES`, `DOTNET_ROOT`, `JAVA_HOME`, `ANDROID_HOME` and `TOOLCHAIN_ROOT`, and puts `dotnet`, `java`, `sdkmanager` and `adb` first on `PATH`. It also turns off .NET CLI telemetry.

### How a part counts as installed

Each part is built in the temporary folder and moved into place only when complete, with an `.installed` file inside it. A folder without that file is treated as not installed and is rebuilt from a fresh download; partial downloads are never reused. A download that fails its checksum stops the script with a message naming the file, and nothing from it is installed.

Two consequences to be aware of:

- An existing folder at one of the four install paths (`godot-4.7.2-stable-mono`, `dotnet-9`, `jdk-17`, `android-sdk`) that has no `.installed` file is **deleted** and rebuilt, whatever it contains.
- The `android-sdk` marker records the pinned command-line tools and package list. Changing either in `setup-toolchain.sh` rebuilds `android-sdk` from scratch, which drops any packages you added by hand with `sdkmanager`.

### Removing it

```sh
rm -rf ~/.local/opt/godot-4.7.2-stable-mono \
       ~/.local/opt/dotnet-9 \
       ~/.local/opt/jdk-17 \
       ~/.local/opt/android-sdk \
       ~/.local/opt/.toolchain-setup-tmp
```

Remove one folder and run the script again to reinstall just that part. `~/.android` can be deleted too if nothing else on the machine uses it.

### Notes

- .NET 9 leaves support on 2026-11-10, and Godot plans .NET 10 export templates for 4.8. Godot 4.7.2's Android export needs the .NET 9 SDK, so 9 is what is installed.
- Godot's documentation lists `build-tools;35.0.1` and `platforms;android-35`, but the 4.7.2 source targets 36, so the 36 set is installed.
- Android Studio, the NDK and CMake are not installed.
- The command-line tools file name and checksum are pinned in `setup-toolchain.sh`; update both from <https://developer.android.com/studio> when moving to a newer release.

## Extraction scripts

The Python scripts here (`saturn_disc.py`, `cgb_textures.py`, `png.py`, `mednafen_state.py`) read the game disc and emulator save states. `tools/mednafen/` is a local emulator install and is git-ignored.
